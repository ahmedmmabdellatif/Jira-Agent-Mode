**Plan**: Fix STATUS.md formatting, update with last successful CI run, and create new iteration log. Then trigger CI and prepare for Confluence UI testing.

**Actions**:
- Edited `docs/STATUS.md` to correct bullet formatting and update documentation structure.
- Committed the fix with message `docs: fix STATUS.md formatting`.
- Waited for GitHub Actions workflow `Forge CI/CD` to complete successfully (run #34 for commit `f8a895c`).
- Updated `docs/STATUS.md` again to record the successful CI run (run ID 16880757368) with its URL and committed with message `docs: update STATUS.md with CI run`.

**Results**:
- STATUS.md now lists the last successful CI run and has properly formatted bullet points.
- The CI workflow completed successfully: [Forge CI/CD run 16880757368](https://github.com/ahmedmmabdellatif/Jira-Agent-Mode/actions/runs/16880757368) for commit `f8a895c`.

**Next**:
- Proceed to test the Confluence macro in the UI: ensure the macro inserts correctly, sets the JQL and max results, and verify the initial rendering "UI Kit React is rendering" message and JQL display.
- Document the outcomes in a new log file and update the state file accordingly.
